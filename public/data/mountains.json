A straightforward 3km distance, and 300 metres height gain, from the ski area - roughly 90 minutes travel. \r\nBetween 1997 and 2029, to your right (east), you look down to a broad snow basin, Crystal Valley, where runs of up to 700 vertical metres can be taken. After good snowfalls in winter down to 1000m, dedicated skiers can ski all the way from point 2029 down to the Porter Heights road, up to 1000 vertical metres of skiing, with perhaps a kilometre of walking at the end.\r\nThere are good ski basins on the other side of the ridge (the headwaters of the Goldney River) although being north-west facing, they may not always have a good snow cover. From point 1997 a steep gully descends north-west. The climb back up again is just as steep! Also from point 1981 a nice gully descends north to about 1500m elevation.\r\nSouth Face descends from the Blue Hill peak down towards Coleridge Pass to the south. Divert eastwards at about 1350 metres and ski (and walk if necessary) back to the Porter Heights road. This south-facing slope is very exposed to the winds that blow through the pass, so it can be extremely icy at times.",

Fortunately, a small gravel lead on the true left from about I34 040706 gives good travel upvalley for several hundred metres past it. Cross back and continue, sometimes in side channels, on the true right to major forks at the second side creek, 2.5 hours from the road, I35 049697. Camping is possible here. At these forks, the main (true left) stream heads into a gorge. Less than 100m up the open bed of the true right branch, pick up cairns and markers on the true left where the track up the spur begins. DoC has just recut this track (2009). Carry water from here, as there is no reliable water source higher up. Follow this to the tops, where there is possible to camp. Occasionally there is a smidgeon of water in a tiny tarn near the bushline, 3 hours from the forks. Regard the rest of the ridge as waterless except for higher snow patches. Tussock leads up the spur to gravel or snow and rock outcrops on the range at pt 2194m.

Either way there tends to be some steep, slippery terrain hidden in the beech forest. Once treeline is reached travel along the wide open ridge is easy. Steepening rock is encountered about 300m short of the summit, in winter the snow/ice allows fairly easy travel (beware of cornices!), in summer expect loose, gruddy rock. An alternative is to track west under the ridge rocks using a series of interlinked scree/snow gullies that lead to the summit, this makes an easier descent route (take care in winter as these are also avalanche paths).",

From Lake Browning, descend west toward Hall Creek, sidling in on the Main Divide side and crossing two tiny gullies en route. Cross Hall Creek at about the 1240-metre contour above a small waterfall (the creek is confined below this) and continue up the valley, initially on the true right. There are some nice but open campsites on moss at about the 1280\u2013 metre contour. Gravel gives way to snow slopes that lead to Hall Col. An easy scrambling side trip on bedrock leads up to a flat-topped peak at Pt 1950 metres, where there are extensive views. To access the Retreat Snowfield, descend from the north-western corner of Hall Col. Continue down to the gravel moraine around Farquharson Saddle, a cool place to camp in fine weather. A small stream is usually flowing on gravel 100 metres north-east of Farquharson Saddle. Two routes lead to Griffiths Saddle, one using the upper gullies of Gifford Stream and the other the Main Divide ridge before sidling the last few hundred metres into the saddle. To approach Clarkes Pass from Griffiths Saddle, descend into Griffiths Stream and climb up to Clarkes Pass directly. It is tempting to keep height and sidle, but it is more messy than it looks. Active scree and loose, steep gullies of clay rock make travel arduous and unpleasant, and there is significant stone fall to watch for. South-west from Clarkes Pass, Commodore Peak is approached up snow slopes. The Divide just here is broad, with basins and outcropping shards of rock. Mt Ambrose is easily approached from Commodore Peak. From there, either descend to Hokitika Saddle, or else head north and west from Mt Ambrose down a gravel gully to the 1900-metre contour and then swing further west into a gravel basin draining towards the Kokatahi. This route then ascends a gravel and tussock basin back to the ridge at J34 652986 / BV19 552 370. Snow slopes lead to Pt 2006 metres, from where gravel slopes and bedrock lead easily north-west into the saddle before The Rampart. There is one small tarn 30 metres above the saddle on the way down. Allow two days from Browning Pass to Mt Ambrose in reasonable conditions. From this saddle (J34 642988 / BV19 542 372), a shallow gravel gully offers a good route down to join Park Stream about 200 metres up from Sokota Creek.",

(Climb directly up snowgrass and scree to the top as a side trip.)\r\nFollow more cairns and blazes onto Anatoki Peak, but it is a demanding route and requires a rope to climb a steep exposed rock cliff. This is tiger country with no easy exits. For the well-prepared who wish to try it: From below the northern tooth, follow the first ridge up for 50m, then sidle across, down to the bush edge, where there is a large cairn. Follow blazes through bush. The route then goes along the side of a steep spur. Cross a stream and down through a patch of bush before coming out on a scrubby ledge (small campsite here). Along the ledge, a coil of wire indicates the start of a zigzag \u2018staircase\u2019 with small blazes, which leads up a scrubby 70m cliff. Then climb diagonally up steep rock (a rope should be used on this pitch) to the ridge and cairns at the top. Cross to the next spur beyond the tarn, sidling down in a southerly direction, through slabs past the tarn. From two cairns, go down a spur on snowgrass or slabs for 100m, directly to the bush. Look for markers to the left of and below an enormous rock in the bush. Bushcrash for 30m, climb a bank, then follow down an open ledge. The route crosses prominent streams to a rocky creek.

		"description": "Among the celestial visitors were four sons of Raki who were named Ao-raki , Raki-roa , Raki-rua, and Raraki-roa . They came down in a canoe which was known as Te Waka o Aoraki. They decided to return to their celestial home, but the karakia which should have lifted the waka back to the heavens failed and the canoe fell back into the sea and turned over onto its side. The waka listed and settled with the west side much higher out of the water that the east. Aoraki and his brothers clambered on to the high side and were turned to stone. They are still there today. Aoraki is the highest peak and his brothers are the next highest peaks near him \u2013 Rakiroa (Mount Dampier), Rakirua (Mount Teichelmann), Rarakiroa (Mount Tasman).\nTo Ng\u0101i Tahu, Aoraki represents the most sacred of ancestors, from whom Ng\u0101i Tahu descend and who provide the iwi with its sense of communal identity, solidarity and purpose. The ancestor embodied in the mountain remains the physical manifestation of Aoraki, the link between the supernatural and the natural world.\nThe tapu associated with Aoraki is significant to the tribal value, and is the source of the power over life and death which the mountain possesses. Standing on the very top the the mountain denigrates it's tapu status, and climbers are encouraged to stay off the true summit. \nAoraki / Mount Cook is the highest mountain in New Zealand. Its height, as of 2014, is listed as 3,724 metres (12,218 feet). It sits in the Southern Alps, the mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. Aoraki / Mount Cook consists of three summits: from south to north, the Low Peak (3,593 m or 11,788 ft), the Middle Peak (3,717 m or 12,195 ft) and the High Peak. The summits lie slightly south and east of the main divide of the Southern Alps / K\u0101 Tiritiri o te Moana, with the Tasman Glacier to the east and the Hooker Glacier to the southwest.\nDespite its modest height relative to other mountains internationally, to approach Aoraki from 700 metres above sea level is involves technically challenging climbing with a high level of glaciation. Its level of difficulty is often underestimated and can change dramatically depending on weather, snow and ice conditions. The climb crosses large crevasses, and involves risks of ice and rock falls, avalanches and rapidly changing weather conditions. The approach is often avoided by helicopter due to difficult travel and route-finding. Aoraki has claimed the lives of 70+ climbers since the first ascent in 1894 by New Zealanders Tom Fyfe, Jack Clarke and George Graham. The climbing season traditionally runs from November to February, and hardly a season goes by without at least one fatality.\nThe Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai (DOC) runs the Aoraki Mount Cook Alpine Rescue Team (AMCART) and the Visitor Centre at Aoraki Mount Cook Village. DOC maintains an intentions system which national park users are encouraged to use, to aid in search and rescue. Intentions can either be filled out at the Vistors Centre in the foyer, or sent via e-mail to mtcookvc@doc.govt.nz\nMountain conditions can be found by calling the Visitor Centre, Alpine Guides Ltd, or on various conditions pages spread throughout social media. The Mountain Safety Council runs a website with public avalanche forecasting and public observations.",

				"description": "While this is the easiest and most climbed route on Aoraki/Mount Cook, it is also one of the most dangerous, being menaced by icecliffs. The lower glacier is often heavily crevassed and there is considerable danger from ice avalanches off the right (Divide) slopes. At the head of the glacier under the Gunbarrel (the prominent and active icecliffs of the Upper Linda), traverse left very quickly across the Linda Shelf to join Zurbriggen Ridge below the Summit Rocks (these provide access to the summit, which is over 400m above). A 150m gully that runs directly from the Linda Shelf to the start of the Summit Rocks is a popular alternative to traversing to the Zurbriggen junction. Climb the rocks - there is usually a series of ice gullies running up through the rocks which make for easier climbing. Late in the season parties may need to venture further toward the East Face. Once above the Summit Rocks follow the north-east ice cap to the summit. The easiest way to get onto the summit ridge is to traverse to the west, overlooking the North Ridge and Sheila Face, and climb a short step to follow a sustrugi filled ramp that leads to the top. Due to the 1991 avalanche the very top is probably not a smart place to stand and climbers are asked to respect the wishes of Ngai Tahu by not standing on the very top. The Linda Glacier is the most common descent route from Aoraki/Mount Cook. Most parties use two abseils (100m) when descending the Summit Rocks. As a result there can be a \u2018Christmas tree\u2019 of abandoned slings and other assorted anchors in the rock and ice. Check these thoroughly before using them for abseiling. There have been numerous falls on this part of the route. As a general rule, ascents of the \u2018Linda\u2019 take anywhere from 15-18hrs or more depending on conditions and the speed of the party. It\u2019s a big day out in any language. To make sure it\u2019s one to remember: get fit, plan, prepare and practice. If there are many parties intending to do the Linda (or Zurbriggen) - try to avoid a Summit Rocks bottleneck \u2013 and don\u2019t forget your camera. \r\nA flat section on the Bowie Ridge above Teichelmann\u2019s Corner, accessible from the Linda Glacier, provides a relatively safe bivvy spot.

The overhang is followed by a long snow ar\u00eate, towards the top of which the Coxcomb is joined by the North East Ridge.

The Otago party spent four nights out, two in a snow cave where the ridge meets the Coxcomb. To add to their discomfort they received shocks during an electrical storm.  \r\nThe whole epic makes absorbing reading and may have deterred subsequent attempts. However the third party on the climb  found the route to be both practicable and enjoyable. It should be noted that the ridge merges with the upper part of the Coxcomb  and that the most difficult pitches occur on the latter.\r\nAccess from the top of Shipowner Ridge is by traversing the basin of the upper Therma and then up easy crevassed slopes to where the ridge is gained, either by the highest continuous snow tongue on to the ridge or by slabby pitches above a large rock tower, two to three hours from the hut. The ridge is exposed and generally of shattered rock; however, a long sidle on the eastern (Volta) side, about 15 metres below the ridge crest, allows many of the steeper pitches of the lower part of the ridge to be avoided. A more difficult section occurs higher up, before 200 metres of steep snow lead on to the Coxcomb Ridge. The remaining part of the Coxcomb appears to require at least as much time as the North East Ridge. The climb, including a descent by the North West Ridge has been done in 12 hours.",

Easy slabs soon steepen to a 60 degree prominent light grey band, the top of which is about a third of the way up the climb. Cross the slabs going from right to left and go across a ledge which is very exposed over the North Face. Then follow the crest of the buttress. A series of gullies on the North Face should be on your left. Near the top of the buttress  broken rock just to the east of the ridge crest is followed by a short pitch of snow before the final rock step, which is turned by shallow gullies on the east. A short snow or ice slope then leads directly to the summit. The rock grade is about 13 and if it gets any harder than that then you are possibly off route. When the buttress is iced up with riming the mixed climbing is good. Beware of falling ice. \r\nThe first ascent began as a reconnaissance, but even with a three-man rope the climb was completed from the foot of the buttress in the remarkable time of 3 1/2 hours.",

Three prominent buttresses follow.  The first is climbed by a steep rock couIoir to gain a snow ridge above, from where an easier mixed section leads to the second buttress.  This is the crux of the climb as it overhangs slightly at the bottom and although the rock is sound, there are few holds. Brown and Hutchins climbed it direct but a break in the west side may offer an easier route. \r\nThe upper part of the buttress consists of a smooth vertical face at the top of a sharp snow ar\u00eate, and was turned on a narrow and exposed crack on the eastern side of the ridge. The third buttress is climbed by a crooked chimney well round on the west side.  Above this steep snow leads to the summit towers, of which the easternmost is the highest and is climbed by easy rock on its north-west side. \r\nThe first ascent was made in heavily iced conditions and took about nine hours from Matukituki Saddle to the summit.",

Other parties have traversed out to the north and then climbed steep snow to the snow arete at 1900m. Ascend the final point to the ridge, either by going straight up (beware cornices) or sidle around to the south where you can ascend a steep gully for 30m. \r\n\r\nFrom here travel north along the skyline taking in all the high points. Multiple bivy spots are found along the way. The overall quality of the rock on this ridgeline is quite good, especially over the first third of the traverse. The rock deteriorates as you near Pt. 2072.  3 rappels were required off the various high points - these will depend on conditions and your confidence. Descent was into Paradise Creek via steep snow slopes east of Pt. 2072,. There is a hunters/game trail that sidles/parallels Paradise Gorge. This spits you into the Hopkins Valley just upstream of the Huxley river mouth. The first ascensionists soloed the whole route over two days and found ice up to WI3/rock climbing up to Grade 12.",

Bruce was an experienced and talented climber who had contributed much to New Zealand climbing and Search and Rescue. His death starkly illustrated that mountains can be both beautiful and dangerous places. \nWe had just finished a double rope lower and had packed up the gear, safety line last. It was warmer, the sun had shone for a while and it had stopped snowing. But as we moved to safe ground along a large sloping ledge, a gust of wind blew me off balance and I clutched at the low scrub. Then Chris screamed, 'Bruce, Bruce, Oh my God, Bruce!' and I turned to see a flash of blue fly through the air. Bruce was falling, rolling and tumbling, cartwheeling and turning, like an astronaut on a weightless space walk, only there was no lifeline. Suddenly it was cold again; Bruce was gone.\nSimon Cox, New Zealand Alpine Journal, 1985.",

				"description": "Grade 2\t\t\t\t\t640 metres\r\nThe skifield of \u201cMount Cheeseman\u201d is actually on the south-east slopes of Mount Cockayne \u2013 a mountain named after Leonard Cockayne (1855-1934), a well-known Canterbury botanist and conservationist. Cheeseman is a friendly little skifield, with 2 T-bar lifts, snow groomers and an on-snow accommodation lodge, and it\u2019s a good alternative to Mount Hutt when skiing from Christchurch. Cheeseman sell single T-bar ride tickets to the top of the skifield for a modest $5, giving good access to backcountry basins. There\u2019s a backcountry avalanche risk advisory board at the top of the lifts.\r\nThe large basin to the south of the ski area, in the headwaters of Tim\u2019s Stream, is known as \u201cTarn Basin\u201d, and is popular with skiers and boarders going out from the ski area. There are good turns to be had from the top of the lifts (1840m) all the way down to the 1500 metre level, or lower. Many people ski only as far as the frozen tarn at 1620 metre elevation, before returning to the ski area via a small col on the intervening ridge at 1760m.\r\nTo head towards Olympus and the Ryton Valley, tour south-west 2\u00bd km along the ridge to the peak of Mount Cheeseman itself (2030m) in 75 to 90 minutes. Beware of cornices that often form on the eastern side of this ridge. There\u2019s a good run off point 1950 east down into Tarn Basin, and also a nice basin to the west (the headwaters of Hut Creek), which sees a lot less traffic than Tarn Basin.\r\nFrom the top of Mount Cheeseman itself, you look south-west into the undulating slopes of the upper Ryton Valley. Ski off the peak into the Ryton for 150 vertical metres, and then traverse to the skier\u2019s right (west) to reach the central gully of the Ryton, which often holds lovely powder snow. This gully is a nice consistent 20\u00ba gradient down to flats at the 1420m level, i.e. a 600 vertical metre run from the top of Mt Cheeseman. 75-90 minutes skinning back to the top for another run down. You can spend a whole day here cutting fresh tracks and return to the Cheeseman ski area, or go on to the Mount Olympus ski area.\r\nTo Mt Olympus ski area from the peak of Mount Cheeseman, it is easy travel west on the ridge towards spot elevation 1836, and then across a broad saddle and then a gradual 200 metre climb SW onto the north shoulder of Mount Olympus at about 2000m. Depending upon snow cover, it\u2019s a ski traverse or it may be a walk on rocky slopes to get around to the west ridge of Mt Olympus, where snow slopes lead down to the upper basins of Mt Olympus ski area. (Windwhistle Winter Sports Club). 7\u00bdkm or around 3 hours from skifield to skifield direct.",

Continue south along the ridge crest to Mt Izard (2019m), and  Mt Cloudsley (2107). From here to the summit of Mount Enys (2194m) the ridge is broader with easier travel. 8\u00bdkm or around 3 to 4 hours from the peak of Mt Cheeseman to Mt Enys.\r\nSkiing off Mt Cheeseman to the south-east takes you into the headwaters of Waterfall Creek for a ski descent of 500 metres or more. Similar basins exist to the south-east of Mt Izard (Long Creek) and Mt Cloudsley (Whitewater Stream). The climb back to the ridge should be straightforward. The slopes on the western side of the range, facing into the lower Ryton Valley, are often wind-blasted free of snow, or melted by the heat of the sun, and are usually only worth skiing in good mid winter conditions. Best travel is along the ridgeline, and if necessary sidling on the eastern side.",

There are several options from Lawrence River.\nThe Couloir is the classic route to the summit of Couloir Peak, pioneered by the redoubtable Stan\nConway and Tom Newth and the scene of their legendary 2500-foot fall during a storm on the\ndescent. After their successful climb, an avalanche knocked Tom off his feet, he collided with Stan and\nthey tumbled down the couloir in a long series of arcs, alternately airborne, then pounding into the ice\nas the rope between them became taught and reined in their flight. Eventually the rope coiled around\nTom and the arcing stopped. One last flight saw them clear rocks at the bottom of the couloir before\nhitting the n\u00e9v\u00e9 and rolling to a stop millimetres from the edge of a crevasse. Both were injured, with\nStan having to be evacuated by horse. Despite this, Tom was able to show up for work the next day\nand the incident was glossed over \u2013 although it was more than 20 years before the route was repeated.",

From the shoulder up to the Cul de sac is lower angled, around 50-60 degrees and requires a \u2018grind it down\u2019 attitude. These pitches could be simul-climbed by a confident party. In the cul de sac there are two to three more technical pitches before the final gully to the summit.\r\nIt is one of the great classic climbs in New Zealand and rivals a lot of similar routes in the Aoraki/Mt Cook area for comparable steepness and length. Most parties pitching all the route could expect to bivvy somewhere. Stories of climbers ending up near the top without bivvy gear and shivering away a winters\u2019 night are common, and in the style of the first ascent. There are no easy descent routes that could be attempted in the dark. However if the Crosscut Bluff descent is in good condition, avalanche wise and there is a full moon it could almost be pleasant.\r\nThe first section was climbed by Doug Warren and Ken Calder in 1973.

At a rock rib that cuts westward, climb back to the divide, crossing it, and descend on the Hooker Valley side, traversing below the divide. This cross-over point is crucial.

For the well-prepared who wish to try it: From below the northern tooth, follow the first ridge up for 50m, then sidle across, down to the bush edge, where there is a large cairn. Follow blazes through bush. The route then goes along the side of a steep spur. Cross a stream and down through a patch of bush before coming out on a scrubby ledge (small campsite here). Along the ledge, a coil of wire indicates the start of a zigzag \u2018staircase\u2019 with small blazes, which leads up a scrubby 70m cliff. Then climb diagonally up steep rock (a rope should be used on this pitch) to the ridge and cairns at the top. Cross to the next spur beyond the tarn, sidling down in a southerly direction, through slabs past the tarn. From two cairns, go down a spur on snowgrass or slabs for 100m, directly to the bush. Look for markers to the left of and below an enormous rock in the bush. Bushcrash for 30m, climb a bank, then follow down an open ledge. The route crosses prominent streams to a rocky creek.

It\u2019s about another 300 metres of climbing, over point 2046, and past Carn Brea to get to the summit (6km, or 2\u00bd to 3 hours in total from the ski area).\r\nAnother, usually preferable, way to reach the summit is to ski north off point 1981, as described above, into the headwaters of the Goldney. From there Mount Enys is seen straight ahead, up a broad 700 vertical metre slope. This is about the same time from the ski area, but you get more turns in.\r\nThe return journey is slightly quicker, but beware of afternoon cloud build-up. If it\u2019s misty on the ridge during the return, be sure to take the ridge that goes SW off point 2029, and not SE. \r\nAfter good snowfalls, the descent from Mt Enys back past Carn Brea into Enys Stream can give over 1000 vertical metres of skiing, although then you\u2019re faced with a long and steep climb back up to the ridge. The untracked 6km tramp across country down to Highway 73 is not recommended! Allow 2 hours if doing it.",

But the climbing is as awesome as it was originally perceived to be, as Peter Dickson and his Polish partner, Miroslavc Sveticic found out when they made the first ascent in 1990. The pair accessed the face directly from Ruth Flat up the waterfall issuing from the face. In Peter\u2019s understated comment \u2018It\u2019s not a good way to get there\u2019, he sums up how well defended the face is. \nThe West Ridge of Fastness and first ascent of the peak was completed by Paul Powell, Colin Marshall, John Sage and Earle Riddiford in Dec 1945 from a camp on the Volta Glacier. Twenty years later Paul Powell was again camped on the Volta, this time to make the first ascent of the North Ridge with Keith Skinner, Peter Child and Geoff Bayliss on January 2, 1965.\nThe South Ridge was first ascended by Garth Matterson, Don Mee and Dave Tarrant on January 4, 1959.

Although the first buttress is the most technically demanding part of the climb, the first party considered a very steep, poorly protected pitch of mud and rubbish necessary to bypass the third step, as the crux. It may be possible to bypass this pitch by continuing straight up the buttress, although this may be more technical. \r\n\r\nTimes.

There are usually skier tracks to follow. In years of good snow cover, rather than traversing to BR directly, it is possible to continue skiing down the centre of Allan\u2019s Basin all the way down to a bend on the skifield access track at about 1300m. Then it\u2019s about 20 minutes walk up the track to the BR lifts. Broken River ski club honour Craigieburn Valley ski tickets (and vice versa) so you can do a few runs here before returning. Always introduce yourself to the very friendly ski patrol, so that they know who\u2019s on the mountain at all times.\r\nTo return to Craigieburn, ride Broken River\u2019s highest rope tow, that leads up the ridge to Nervous Knob.

				"description": "A small tongue of ice from the Garden of Eden flows through the col and peters out in a small basin. Below here, at about the 1860m contour, a series of rocky knolls lead to small bluffs with a series of gullies draining between them. The easiest route down doesnt follow the gully on the far true left (which normally requires confined rock moves if there isnt continuous snow) but instead goes down the gully to the immediate right of it. This gully is more open and all that is required is easy scrambling between the bluffs leading down to gentler scree slopes. \r\n\r\nFrom Adams Col, head down the snow basin and as it starts to drop off keep left under rockwalls on Guardian Peak. Near where it actually drops off, switch over the first rocky rib to the right and scramble down to an easy gully of scree and snowslopes below. You're down. \r\n\r\nIn the reverse direction going up from near Icefall Lookout follow snowslopes towards the col then sidle slightly left (looking up) onto scree. Follow the scree up a gully through a break in the bluffs to the basin above and the col.  \r\n\r\nContinuing to the Garden of Allah \r\nFrom the gentler snow slopes north of Adams Col at about the 1800m contour, follow down under bluffs swinging east across a snow and gravel basin past I35 226632. It is normal to descend to about the 1740m contour before gaining height again. Travel varies from snowslopes to gravel and a bit of easy bedrock, depending on conditions. Thirty years ago continuous gentle snowslopes filled this basin. Steeper snow leads up again to the snow shoulder south of pt 1874m. Watch for changing snow texture climbing up to this shoulder, as snow frequently thins here over summer to expose old ice. A good route sidles up to the left through the middle of the snowbank between two small rock bluffs onto the gentler slopes above. Alternatively stay over near the John Pascoe Ridge side.  \r\n\r\nContinuing to the glacier draining Angel Col \r\nThis is easily accessed from the snowslopes under (north of) Adams Col too. Much of this route in late summer crosses recently exposed rock ground smooth by past ice. The descent to the glacier itself is steeper but not normally difficult. It may be necessary to sidle south a little to find a gully down.",

As you work south, stay reasonably close to the bluffs until a rocky, tussocky shelf with tarns is reached west of pt 1189. This area offers good camping.\r\n\r\nBetween this shelf and the rock slopes and snowfields below Lady Of The Snows lies a bluff probably 60-80m high. Most parties will require a rope for at least part of this bluff. Roughly speaking, the route up the bluff involves heading up to a somewhat vegetated ledge to true right of one of the falls closest to the true left of the bluff. The route then sidles along this ledge before reaching a point where it is necessary to walk through the waterfall. The climb immediately on the true left of the waterfall is where our party required the rope for a pitch of perhaps 10 or 15 metres. The north face of Lady Of The Snows can be climbed in about 25 minutes from the uppermost point of the snowfields below her summit, although this route can require some fairly steep clambering.",

The first few hundred metres above the saddle has many tension cracks about 0.5m deep. Fine in daylight but easy to miss by head torch, and not good in wet conditions. There is a good campsite near some large boulders at about 1940m, and in winter and spring there will usually be snow hereabouts. Elsewhere the spur is waterless. Angle up easy slopes to an obvious dip in the main range. In summer it may be necessary to camp in the Stace Creek basin below this dip.

Sidle the north-western slopes of this peak by initially ascending the west ridge to around 2000m elevation. Either continue NE towards an 1800m col and gentle slopes at the head of the Ryton Valley, or descend into the Ryton SE from point 1974 where the slopes steepen as they descend.\r\nAn alternative way to access the mid Ryton Valley is via \u201cThe Sphinx\u201d, a col at 1920m, grid ref 973789, very obvious from window of the Mt Olympus main lodge. Traverse across to the east from the top of the lifts until directly under the Sphinx and climb on foot straight up 160 metres or so to the col. From there SE-facing slopes lead down to the floor of the Ryton Valley.\r\nIn good snow cover it is possible to ski all the way down the Ryton to \u201cCoach Corner\u201d at 1000m elevation on the access road (grid ref 969757). The last few km may not have much snow on the valley sides, but an old farm track usually holds enough snow to allow ski or snowboard travel.\r\nACCESS: Please note that the Ryton valley is private property and has recently changed ownership (2022). It is no longer acceptable to tour through the Ryton valley from a starting point other than Mt Olympus ski area and essential to check with skifield operations before touring outside of the area boundaries.",

Start just to the left of this \ncentral feature to avoid rockfall potentionally funneling down from the top.  \nThere is only 1 place to start here because either side of it has overhanging \nrock.  Do not be tempted to start further out left of this because promising \nrock invariably ends up in dangerously loose ground after 2 pitches. Use your \neyes to pick the correct line and make sure it all connects up.  There is \nonly 1 possible line on this side of the 'funnel'.  Climb easy ground \neventually moving onto an easy rib, this rib is essentially the left side of \nthe gully below this big \"V\" feature.  At a particular point on the rib it \nchanges, (getting steeper?).\nDuring inspection from the bottom of the face you should have already noted a \nseries of ascending ledges about 2/3 the way up, leading to the left like a \nstaircase.  During this ledge traverse you will find a potential excellent \nunused flat bivvy protected from above by an overhanging wall.  After that \nthere are no flat bivvys and the one sitting bivvy is exposed to rockfall (we \nstarted the climb at 2pm so had to bivvy). After going left up those ledges \ngo up an unlikely looking loose wide corner (17/18) using a 'rib'  just to \nthe right of it to finally break through some steep ground and gain access to \nthe final headwall.  The headwall overhang is intimidating.  Towards the \nright hand end of it, and hopefully now directly above you, you should see a \nweakness that may have ice choking it.  Chop this away and crank over it \n(15/16).  From here it is just 1 pitch to the top of the face, but expect a \nfew surprises after that.",

The lower one forms a triangular face with the snow shelf beneath giving access to the Avalanche Glacier. The route traverses this shelf to a point from which the north edge of the triangular face can be gained. This edge provides enjoyable climbing on steep rock, but it could be avoided by traversing the ledge further towards the Avalanche Glacier, where a snow route allows a return to the ridge above the first step. \r\n\r\nThere is a variation on the left side of the first rock step up an ill defined gully involving grade 15 rockclimbing on sound rock. The second step, although loose and exposed, is straightforward, as is the rest of the mixed rock and snow ridge to the Low Peak, about five hours from the col. The traverse to the High Peak commences with a gentle descent on an easy snow ar\u00eate until the ridge is blocked by a large gendarme.

It takes about 90 min to reach the base of the Otira Slide icefield. (It is unwise to ascend the slide in darkness because of the high avalanche and rockfall risk in this area. Arrive there at first light if anything!) Climb the ice\u00deeld on the true-right, aiming for the wide couloir at its head that joins the Goldney Ridge. Climb the ridge rock, or drop onto the head of the Goldney Glacier and regain the ridge. Move away from the ridge crest, instead opting to climb the steep shallow gully that leads directly to Low Peak (2212m). If in doubt aim for the large solitary orange rock jutting out of the face, Low Peak is directly behind it. (Grade. 1+) An alternative route from the Slide, is to climb directly onto the face between Low and Middle Peaks. An obvious steep gully (Hidden Couloir) joins the ridge between these summits. It is avalanche prone, and contains loose rock. It must be frozen! (Grade. 2-) Once Low Peak is gained and if the Crow neve is not too crevassed, head for the col past Middle Peak, gaining the ridge to High Peak from there. Otherwise climb over Middle Peak. Note : The Otira Slide may be descended in winter on downhill/telemark skis. You must be an extremely competent skier, and have good avalanche assessment skills.",

On a clear day, the mountain can even be seen from the South Island.Remember that you are on an active volcano. Eruptions large enough to be hazardous to people within the active crater basin (within the circle of Dome, Paretetaitonga and Tahurangi) have a return period of about 10 years. Outside the crater basin the return period is about 20 years. In the last 60 years, a signi\ufb01cant proportion of these eruptions have occurred more or less without warning (so called \u2018blue sky\u2019 eruptions). Lahars (volcanic mud\ufb02ows) can \ufb02ow down any of the major valleys during major eruptions, although only down the Whangaehu valley in smaller ones.

But by autumn the steaming Crater Lake is ringed by stark burnt-orange rocks and dark, ash-covered snow\ufb01elds \u2013 dramatic evidence that the volcano is a restless environment, a place not quite of this world. Although one-way lift tickets up the ski\ufb01eld are available in winter, and during the summer holiday period, \ufb01rst-time visitors may want to walk, if only to gain a better idea of the topography of the mountain: it is not that straightforward. \r\nIn summer, guided walks begin from the top of the ski\ufb01eld chairlifts, up a scoria track to the Crater Lake. In winter, the short climb to the Summit Plateau from the Whakapapa ski\ufb01eld is many North Islanders\u2019 \ufb01rst true alpine experience. \r\nFrom the carpark you can reach the vicinity of the NZAC Ruapehu Hut in about 90 minutes. Follow Tennents Valley to Hut Flat, and then a poled route climbs up Egmont Ridge behind (west of) the Ruapehu Ski Club lodges onto the western side of Delta Ridge. The hut is on the brow of this ridge at 2040m elevation (grid ref 310138). From here there are two main routes. Note that parts of both routes lie in paths followed by lahars on the three occasions they have been recorded on this side of the mountain. Two of these, in 1969 and 1975, occurred in \u2018blue sky\u2019 eruptions. \r\nFrom Delta Corner (the rocky end of Delta Ridge) it\u2019s about another 90 minutes to Glacier Knob. Climb up \u2018The Gut\u2019 \u2013 a popular ski gully between Knoll Ridge and Restful Ridge \u2013 and continue beyond straight up the broad valley to the obvious knob on the skyline. Alternatively, just before the top sidle up and slightly to the climber\u2019s left (east) to reach The Notch. This gives direct access to the Summit Plateau. In winter, watch for snow loading from the westerly quarter. From Glacier Knob it\u2019s worth going south along the ridge to The Dome at 2672m. Here you overlook Crater Lake, and beyond is Tahurangi, the true summit of Ruapehu. Dome Shelter is a small emergency shelter, not intended for overnight use, on top of The Dome at grid ref 313113. During winter the door is often buried by snow and ice, so there is a hatch in the roof for emergency access. This shelter will be removed \u2018when it falls due for replacement\u2019.

From here, continue up the wide valley to reach The Col between The Dome and Paretetaitonga (a further 300m, another 45 minutes). It is a short climb from the Col to the Dome, best made by continuing around underneath and then back up the eastern ridge. In poor visibility the Glacier Knob route is a better descent; when descending the Whakapapa Glacier care needs to be taken to head north-northeast so as to regain the ski\ufb01eld. Failure to do this will leave you amidst the exposed blu\ufb00s of the upper Whakapapaiti valley \u2013 a long long way from anywhere. \r\nThe Whakapapa Glacier formerly \ufb01lled the upper reaches of the valley leading to The Col. Fifty years ago, on April 2, 1954, crevasses across the upper glacier forced Tom and Doris Barcham hard under Paretetaitonga, and then under the Dome to traverse Pyramid. Finally, on Tahurangi they met \u2018very steep hard compacted ash. Cut many steps!\u2019 Earlier that same year, New Zealand Canoeing Association members carried a rubber dingy up to explore Crater Lake. Although people have swum in the lake, with a fairly constant acidity of pH 1 this cannot be recommended. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, about a boat once kept near the crater for research purposes. Over time, the acidity ate away at the nails holding the craft together until on one fateful voyage . . .",

Ascend the slabs true right of the stream (don't drift true left on the slabs or you'll get dizzy), which merge into easier angled scree at about 1600m (bivy sites possible before the ridge proper), and then gain the crest of the north ridge. Above here are three prominent rock buttresses, which are generally broad, with several route possibilities. The rock 'isn't bad'. The climbing mostly involves exposed scrambling with some short steps. The true ridge offers the easiest climbing through the buttresses with difficulties often overcome on the east side. Most parties appreciate using a rope, in at least one location. (An alpine rack of 5 nuts and 3-4 cams is often sufficient with good route finding).\r\nAbove the buttress, the ridge flattens out (another good bivy site) before merging into a glacial bulge. There is sometimes an icecliff here. Above the icecliffs, ascend a vague snow rib to reach a shelf just below the summit. Follow your nose to the top.\r\n\r\nConfidence in climbing un-roped on exposed ground for the majority of this route is required. It is too long to pitch the whole route. The FA party completed the route within a day return to Douglas rock. It has more recently been completed in two days from the road end.\r\n\r\nBeware - tales of epic retreats abound, including rapping off the leashes of ice-axes when getting low on gear to leave behind.\r\n\r\nDescent is usually via Welcome Pass to Scott Creek or Bluewater route.

				"description": "The West Ridge of Mt Sefton from the Douglas N\u00e9v\u00e9 is a relatively straight forward 500m climb and is commonly used as a descent route. To reach the n\u00e9v\u00e9 from the Copland Valley, the best route lies up Scott Creek. Surmount the waterfall on the western side (true L) using vegetated ledges and follow the creek, up and up, trending left. Beyond the bushline a rounded spur on the left can be gained (there are cairn-marked bivvy rocks and a stream in a small vegetated valley just north of the rounded spur) which ascends to a steeper craggy section followed by snowbasins. These in turn lead onto the ridge separating the Scott and Tekano Glaciers. Cross the Tekano N\u00e9v\u00e9 (watch for wet snow!) and ascend to Welcome Pass (2390m). From here follow the Sierra Range to where the West Ridge begins. Alternatively, from Welcome Pass use the Douglas N\u00e9v\u00e9 to access the West Ridge where it steepens. Beware of mist. Bivvying on Welcome Pass makes the summit day easier.",

				"description": "This is currently the recommended route to Welcome Pass, as it avoids the \r\nwaterfalls of the Scott Creek Route and involves a pleasant variety of bush, \r\ntussock, rock, and snow travel. A route has been cut and marked all the way \r\nfrom Scott Creek to the bushline. It was easy to follow in early 2016, and has been newly recut and marked with white permalat markers with a red strip in the summer of 2022/23. (A pair of loppers is left in the bush at the top end if more bush cutting is required). \r\nCare should be taken to find the beginning of the route. It begins on a \r\nbush-covered terrace 20m above Scott Creek on the true right bank, at about \r\n580m, where a small stream (shown on the topomap) flows across the terrace. \r\nThis is referred to here as \u2018Point A\u2019 and is roughly located at about \r\nBX15 563 631. The stream enters Scott Creek on the true right below a massive, moss-covered boulder. Depending on conditions, it might be possible to follow the creek up to Point A.\r\nAccess to Point A from the Scott Creek bed varies seasonally due to massive \r\navalanches in winter and spring that modify the shape of the creek bed and \r\nits high, steep bank. The marked route begins from a small open \r\nterrace 20m further upstream at about 600m \u2013 two cairns mark the route out of Scott Creek and onto the terrace. Permalat markers start on the upper end of the terrace, and a large white permalat X marks the start of the track at the top of the terrace. From there the track loops back on itself and goes back down to Point A. In summer 2022 the track is very well marked in both directions, freshly cut, and easily identifiable.\r\n From Point A, on the true right of the side stream, the route climbs steeply, \r\nveering away from the stream with increasing height. Stick to the marked \r\nroute. Good travel up through rata/podocarp forest, and then mountain \r\nneinei/dracophyllum forest leads to the bushline at 1080m. At 1140m, \r\nthere\u2019s a two-minute detour to a spectacular viewpoint over the Bluewater \r\nbasin. The marked route continues to the top of the scrub at 1300m with warratahs, and then cairns that follow up the obvious slide that goes straight to the bottom of the cliffs of point 1800.\r\nFollow animal trails along the base \r\nof the prominent cliffs. This leads to the final basin below the saddle \r\nbetween Pt 1800m and Pt 1784m (Bluewater Saddle), which is reached via gravel \r\nslopes and rock ledges.\r\n From Bluewater Saddle, drop 20m on the Tekano side, and then traverse and \r\nclimb back onto the ridge south of Pt 1800m. Follow this ridge south for \r\nabout one kilometre, and then ascend on a rising traverse across the Tekano \r\nn\u00e9v\u00e9 \u2013 watch for crevasses and soft afternoon snow \u2013 to Welcome Pass.\r\nIn the reverse direction: when descending below the bluffs, if you overshoot \r\nthe large boulder at 1300m [BX15 573 622], you should encounter an old slip \r\nwith regenerating scrub which leads into the stream marked on the map \r\nbeginning at about BX15 572 624. This can be followed down to about 860m, \r\nwhere there is a short section of pink tape that leads away from the stream \r\nback to the main Bluewater Route. There is a small flat in this stream at \r\nabout 900m which is large enough for one tent.\r\nThe Bluewater Route through the bush has been used by hunters for some time. \r\nThe first recorded use of the full route as a descent from Welcome Pass was \r\nby Danilo Hegg and George O\u2019Sullivan, Jan 2010. The first recorded climb of \r\nMt Sefton using this route was by Nina Dickerhof and James Thornton in Nov \r\n2015",

Split Peaks were first climbed by Bill Cullens, Stan Forbes and Frank Gillett in December 1934. The party had set out to climb The Thumbs but in the absence of any good maps or route descriptions they set off in error up Split Peaks. A view from high on the route revealed their mistake.",

Its graceful shape and visibility have made it one of New Zealand's most photographed and painted mountains. That attraction and the ease of access to this lone alpine peak have probably made it New Zealand's most climbed mountain.\nFor rock climbing on the mountains see https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/ni/taranaki\nSkiing\nIt is possible to ski on Mt Taranaki from April to February, but more reliably between June and December. Snow depths vary with up to 1.5m on the ridges and 15m in the deep valleys, with the surface conditions very changeable particularly during early/mid winter. An icy winter can make skiing on the upper portion of the mountain, above 2100m, impractical until late August. Spring skiing (September to late November) can be excellent.\nClimbing on skis (skinning) has never been very popular as the terrain and usual snow type is not ideal for skinning. In most cases a skier will make faster and easier headway uphill on foot wearing crampons. A sound rule on Mt Taranaki is to always climb up the route you intend to ski down. This is in order to judge the ski route for snow conditions as hard rime, ice or spring sluffs can make unpleasant surprises.\nMost of the summit runs could be classed as adventurous\u2014in particular Surrey Road, and Pleasant Valley. Ultimately enjoyment on the day is dependent on the skier and snow conditions. Teds Alley runs adjacent to and south of East Ridge and could be described as extreme.\nIt is expected that those who want to ski away from the commercial ski areas should be a mountain-wise and well equipped party and at least strong intermediate skiers, preferably better\u2014the upper slopes are continually steep. With good snow conditions skiers can traverse between routes, and very \ufb01t skiers can do two routes in one day.",

There is nothing very steep on this climb, but you need to be comfortable with a lot of air under your feet.The climb is best approached by traversing over Lendenfeld to reach Engineer Col. Above Engineer Col, there is often an icecliff straddling the ridge crest. The route usually follows moderately steep ice gullies on the Plateau Face to where Syme Ridge joins the North Shoulder. Although the section above the col has changed markedly over the last few decades, it still provides a relatively straightforward route onto the shoulder. The broad North Shoulder eventually narrows into an exhilarating ridge, which leads to the summit. Also used as a descent route.",

Follow the riverbank and vestiges of the old FS track up to Redfield Creek. Begin up the creek, but it will be necessary to sidle past several falls, particularly above about the 800m contour. Both the stream above here and an alternative using the spur out to the true left have been used. You choose. Climb up the ridge towards pt 1684m. \r\n\r\nFrom this ridge there are two more alternatives. The first route sidles steep tussock from upper Redfield Creek at about the 1200m to 1300m contour across to another spur coming off pt 1684m bordering Elizabeth Stream and descends to flats in that stream at 1200m. There is good camping here. Cross Elizabeth Stream and ascend the spur on the true right where there are also campsites, with tarns, at about the 1500m contour. Continue towards pt 1898m, crossing to the north side of the ridge at about the 1800m contour and bypassing pt 1898m itself which is a bit gnarly. Sidle under pt 2024m across shingle, easy rock slabs and snow onto what's left of the Adverse Glacier, which isnt much.     \r\n\r\nThe second route sidles a little to the west of pt 1684m on a shelf between 1500m and 1600m before climbing through basins for a kilometre to reach the ridge between pt 1926m and pt 2024m. Continue over to the Adverse Glacier. \r\n\r\nSnowslopes and easy rock, including slabs, then lead to the summit of Great Unknown. Some have had crevasse problems on the Adverse, but normally there should be no problem.  \r\n\r\nTo continue to the Garden of Eden, go a short distance to the north west along a rock rib from the summit of Great Unknown and descend north north east towards a basin at the 1800m contour. Sidle at more or less this height through to the Gardens. \r\nTime: One very big day from the Gardens to Scone Hut. Allow 2 going up.  \r\n \r\nApproached from the Perth using a mostly gravel slip stream beginning at I35 105583.
